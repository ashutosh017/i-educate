            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017â€“18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.[8] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%
                and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[9] India's improved education system is often cited as
                one of the main contributors to its economic development.[10] Much of the progress, especially in higher
                education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in
                higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of
                26.3% in 2019,[11] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education
                enrolment levels of developed nations,[12] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to
                continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher
                absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly
                in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. Government
                'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a
                number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfil all the
                conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that
                schools and parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality.[13]

                At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government
                run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[14] Certain
                post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue
                of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of
                donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians.
                Later, stupas, temples also became centers of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular
                subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these
                orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the
                Sammanas, were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the
                warrior class, the Kshatriya, were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the
                Vaishya, were taught their trade and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of
                educational advantages.[31]

                With the advent of Islam in India the traditional methods of education increasingly came under Islamic
                influence.[32] Pre-Mughal rulers such as Qutb-ud-din Aybak and other Muslim rulers initiated
                institutions which imparted religious knowledge.[32] Scholars such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Moinuddin
                Chishti became prominent educators and established Islamic monasteries.[32] Students from Bukhara and
                Afghanistan visited India to study humanities and science.[32] Islamic institution of education in India
                included traditional madrassas and maktabs which taught grammar, philosophy, mathematics, and law
                influenced by the Greek traditions inherited by Persia and the Middle East before Islam spread from
                these regions into India.[33] A feature of this traditional Islamic education was its emphasis on the
                connection between science and humanitie</p>
